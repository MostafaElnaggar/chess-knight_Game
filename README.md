# chess-knight_Game
This is the Chess-knight game pseudo based on the knights problem, I made that game for it to work as a good introduction to Machine learning and algorithms for new students and future frontiers. the game has a class called player that currently supports two types of playing. Other methods can be added to the player and comparisons can be conducted for different algorithms.
the Game idea is very simple , a chess board is having a knight to take a tour throught it with two players exchanging turns. the one who cannot find a new square to move the knight is considered losing.
the game is consisting of the class called modular that consists of all the functions and the objects needed for the game. the object (class player can be overriden for other coders to join the development)
